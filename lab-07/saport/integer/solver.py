        Abstract Integer Programming Solver

        Attributes
        ----------
        model : Model
            integer programming model to be solved
        timelimit: int
            what is the maximal solving time (in seconds)
        total_time: float
            how long it took to solve the problem
        start_time: float
            when the solving started
        interrupted: bool
            whether solving has been interrupted (by timeout)

        Methods
        -------
        start_timer():
            remember the starting time for the solver
        stop_timer():
            stores the total solving time
        wall_time() -> float:
            returns how long solver has been working
        timeout() -> bool:
            whether solver should stop working due to the timeout

        solve(model: Model, timelimit: int) -> Solution:
            solves the given model within a specified timelimit
